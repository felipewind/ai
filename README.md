## Concepts

LLM
- Large Language Models

Machine Learning Algorithm
- Technique for achieving artificial intelligence

Deep Learning
- ...

Machine Learning Model or simply Model
- Result of training a machine learning algorithm on a particular dataset

Prompt
- A prompt is the input we give to a machine learning model to generate output in the context of Chatgpt

Token
- ...

GPT
- Generative Pre-trained Transformer
- AI *model* that is *pre-trained* and can understand text and *generate* new text.

NLP
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Models
- All models that work with text

Completions
- Generating new text that is similar to the text which was used for training
- We provide a message on the "prompt" and receive one completion
- Is a more general definition of tasks a model can perform
- Categories of completions:
  - Chat completions
  - Text completions
  - Code completions
